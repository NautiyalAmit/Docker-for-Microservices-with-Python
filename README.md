# Docker-for-Microservices-with-Python
Implementation of Hands-On Docker for Micro services with Python: Design, deploy, and operate a complex system with multiple microservices using Docker and Kubernetes

Microservices architecture helps create complex systems with multiple, interconnected services that can be maintained by independent teams working in parallel
• Use Docker containers to create, operate, and deploy your microservices
• Create workflows to manage independent deployments on coordinating services using CI and GitOps through GitHub, Travis CI, and Flux
• Develop a REST microservice in Python using the Flask framework and Postgres database
